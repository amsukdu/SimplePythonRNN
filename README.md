# SimplePythonRNN
This is RNN, LSTM & GRU with Bidirectional only in python & numpy. It is simple and slow but will get the job done :+1:

## Specification
**Type :** Vanilla, LSTM, GRU + Bidrectional

**Weight Initialization :** HE Normal

**Weight Update Policy :** ADAM, ADAGRAD

**Regulization :** Droupout

## Prerequisites
numpy (+ mkl for intel processors. recommend [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads))


## Example
AND gate and CIFAR-10 examples are included.

```python


seq_length = 128
learning_rate = 1e-3
rnn = RNN(
    [
        {'type': 'lstm', 'hidden_size': 256},
        {'type': 'lstm', 'hidden_size': 256},
        {'type': 'lstm', 'hidden_size': 256},
        # {'type': 'lstm', 'hidden_size': vocab_size, 'dropout': 0.5, 'bi': True, 'u_type': 'adagrad'},
    ],
    vocab_size, learning_rate, bi=False)

```

Example RNN is trained by Tolstoy's famous novel "Anna Karenina".
